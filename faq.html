                <h2>WHERE ARE YOU BASED?</h2>
                I am currently based out Amsterdam, NL, but during the summer I am usually in Minneapolis, Minnesota (USA). 
                Iâ€™m obviously always down to travel anywhere and everywhere!

                <h2>WHAT DO YOU STUDY?</h2>
                Despite having a life-long love for photography, I study Artificial Intelligence with an emphasis on the 
                computer science/coding side of AI. Photography, much like coding, is a skill that I believe is better learned 
                by actually practicing, rather than trying to learn from a lecturer. 

                <h2>HOW MANY COUNTRIES HAVE YOU TRAVELED TO?</h2>
                It's hard to get a definite answer for this, as deciding whether to count a country as visited or not
                is a tricky process, however last time I checked, I counted 32 countries.
                Traveling is a huge part of who I am and I love engaging with new cultures and people!

                <h2>WHAT LANGUAGES DO YOU SPEAK?</h2>
                I fluently speak Estonian and English, however I can also pass with some German, and am trying to learn Spanish.

                <h2>WHAT EQUIPMENT DO YOU USE?</h2>
                My camera body is the Canon 6D accompanied by the Canon 35mm 1.4f prime, and Sigma 50mm 1.4f prime.

                <h2>WHO DESIGNED YOUR WEBSITE?</h2>
                Me! Gotta put those HTML/CSS skills to work somehow.
